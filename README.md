## Story Summary

### Beginning
Freddy, a small green frog who loves melodies, hears about the annual Forest Singing Contest and dreams of performing. Though enthusiastic, Freddy is clearly tone‑deaf—his croaks come out off‑key. Encouraged by his friend Rosie and curious firefly Luna, he decides to try out.

### Main Conflict
Freddy struggles to practice; other animals tease or doubt him, and the contest judge, Mr. Owl, seems unimpressed by sloppy singing. Freddy faces the choice to give up, try to sound exactly like others, or keep going in his own voice. He practices with Luna and Rosie, learning techniques but still singing differently. Freddy's perseverance is tested when he is left out of the main stage lineup and must decide whether to perform at the contest’s open‑mic pond or slip away quietly.

### Resolution
Freddy bravely performs at the open‑mic. His song is imperfect but full of heart and joy. The audience—initially puzzled—begins to smile, tapping along. Mr. Owl recognizes Freddy’s courage and invites him to sing again; the community applauds his authenticity. Freddy learns that persistence and being true to himself matter more than perfection. He gains confidence, new friends, and the pride of having shared his unique song.
