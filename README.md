## Story Summary

### Beginning
Milo, a quiet seven-year-old who sketches fantastical creatures but keeps his drawings hidden, discovers a glowing sketchbook left by his art teacher, Ms. Wren. One night, a distant whistle calls and the Dream Train appears at his window. Luna, the warm, whimsical conductor, invites him aboard. Pip, a tiny talking fox who lives on the train, shows Milo that each car opens into a different dream world tied to his creativity and fears.

### Main Conflict
As Milo explores the dream cars—an upside-down library of forgotten stories, a garden of growing ideas, and a storm-car swirling with doubts—he becomes trapped in the storm-car. Forgotten fears threaten to keep him inside the dream. To restart the train and return home, Milo must confront his self-doubt, use his sketches as tools, and apply lessons learned from the other cars while accepting help from Pip and Luna.

### Resolution
Milo reaches the engine room and, by using a drawing from his glowing sketchbook to remember who he is, lights the Dream Lantern that powers the train. He awakens at dawn with renewed confidence, shares a drawing at school, and discovers that imagination plus small acts of courage helps him face real-life challenges.
